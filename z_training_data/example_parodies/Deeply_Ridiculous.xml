But the HARPOON HOOK, which holds the tow-line and is embedded into the rear deck of the ship, is starting to PRY LOOSE, its metal groaning under the strain. It JERKS and BUCKS against the metal wall, threatening to tear free at any moment. Canton, oblivious to the impending danger, doesn't notice this as he slips and slides his way up to the railing, muttering about insurance claims and early retirement. He spots the Saipan and smiles, anticipating his imminent escape. Then he looks off at -- 118 ISLAND 118 rising majestically out of the ocean, beckoning him with its promise of sun-drenched beaches and fruity cocktails. About a mile away, Canton starts to climb over the railing, his toupee nearly escaping in the process. And that's when the HARPOON HOOK RIPS FREE with a deafening roar, WHIZZES FORWARD, and IMPALES Canton's LEG, pinning him to the railing like a hapless butterfly on a display board. He SCREAMS, his voice echoing across the stormy waters, and tries to spin free, but the hook holds firm, refusing to relinquish its grasp. The hook hangs onto his leg for a long, agonizing BEAT as Canton continues to SCREAM, his toupee flapping wildly in the wind. Then the HOOK RIPS FREE, tearing a chunk of flesh from his leg, grabs the METAL RAILING, and starts TEARING IT off the deck, leaving behind a trail of mangled metal and shattered dreams. Canton drops to the deck, clutching his leg and whimpering in pain, his dreams of island paradise fading with each passing second. And then he sees it -- 119 SPEEDBOAT 119 dangling seductively from its harness down on the watersports platform, offering him a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. 120 TO SCENE 120 Canton, driven by a primal urge for survival, starts to crawl towards the speedboat, moaning and bleeding, his toupee askew, resembling a wounded sea lion dragging itself across the sand.
