The trailer does a high-five with the sky, breaks free, and goes rogue. I hit the gas, the Pinto surges forward, suddenly unburdened. Freedom! I peek in the rearview mirror and see the trailer embarking on a solo adventure. Then, CRUNCH! I kiss the bumper of a Smart Car parked at the intersection. The Smart Car's gas tank cracks, spewing fuel like a caffeinated fountain. I bail out of the Pinto and watch the chaos unfold with wide-eyed glee. Down the hill - the runaway trailer sideswipes a hot dog stand and does a tango. Hipsters sipping soy lattes at the outdoor caf\u00e9 look up to see the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE hurtling toward them. The hot dog cart veers wildly. The hipsters scatter like cockroaches under a spotlight. The cart mows down the patio umbrellas and crashes into a pottery barn. A geyser of ketchup and mustard erupts where the cart once stood. The trailer continues its kamikaze mission toward the busy cross street below. KA-BLOOEY!

The cop car spins like a top, colliding with a shipment of live chickens. The feathered inmates take to the sky. The Pinto continues its demolition derby, plowing into the cheese shop like a runaway Zamboni. The gas canisters in the trunk ignite, and the cheese shop explodes in a fromage-fueled inferno. The trailer's propane tanks join the party with a resounding BOOM. The Smart Car comes flying into the flaming mess and detonates, sending shards of metal and cheese graters raining down on the spectators. The blaze ignites the trail of gasoline, and a river of fire races up the hill, stopping at Nick's feet. He watches the pandemonium - the smoke plumes, the geyser of ketchup, the airborne chickens.
